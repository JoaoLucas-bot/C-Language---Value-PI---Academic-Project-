# C Language - Value PI - Academic Project 
Regarding the statement, it is intended to implement the algorithm of “Monte Carlo” simulation, which will work as an estimate of the value of π, using various “threads” and points.
Considering a square and a circle defined therein, using the method of “Monte Carlo”, a certain amount of random points will be generated. The goal is we notice how many of these points are inside the circle, dividing this count by
by the total points generated. Multiplying this result by 4, we get Approximate value of π.
According to the statement, we have 4 samples of points and "threads" of execution, obtaining several approximate values of π. Our main objective is to analyze compare and comment on the results obtained.
This type of simulations are used to model financial systems, simulate telecommunications networks, calculate results for high-dimensional integrals. the technique of “Monte Carlo” is also used in modeling a wide range of systems physicists at the forefront of scientific research, for example.
This work was developed by students Paulo Correia (30002232), Eduardo Araújo (30008290), Pedro Amaral (30008241) and João Lucas (30008215), from the Computer Engineering, 1st year.
